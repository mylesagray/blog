      <description>I had a question last week from Bozo Popovic during our EMEA field SE training session on vSAN operations relating to SPBM support for service providers that use vCloud Director in their environments.

      <title>Migrating vSAN vmkernel ports to a new subnet</title>

      <description>After deploying a vSAN cluster, the need sometimes arises to make changes to its network configuration, such as migrating the vmkernel network of the cluster to a new subnet. This requirement may appear for example when changing the network in which the vSAN cluster is running, or even, in a more complex scenario such as when a standalone vSAN needs to be converted to a stretched cluster.
In these sorts of situations, complications may be encountered if the subnet in use for the vSAN vmkernel ports cannot be routed to the network as a whole, as it is in use elsewhere in the organization, and is currently isolated in an L2 segment.</description>

      <description>After a long an arduous certification and regression testing process following many problems with LSI 3108 based controllers that I have been using for VSAN they are finally VSAN 6.2 certified.
Having seen and opened multiple tickets about strange controller behaviors (hot add controller do VMware have released a FW/HW and Software combo that, according to a highly regarded VMware internal storage resource:
 Its certainly the most tested combination of a firmware/driver/controller ever at this point [&amp;hellip;] My understanding is the reason this took so long is they didnâ€™t just fix the big issue, but also minor ones too, and any minor regressions</description>
