      <description>Intro I have been experimenting a lot over the past 18 months with containers and in particular, Kubernetes, and one of the core things I always seemed to get hung up on was part-zero - creating the VMs to actually run K8s. I wanted a CLI only way to build a VM template for the OS and then deploy that to the cluster.
It turns out that with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (in particular the cloud image OVA) there are a few things need changed from the base install (namely cloud-init) in order to make them play nice with OS Guest Customisation in vCenter.</description>

      <title>Migrating vSAN vmkernel ports to a new subnet</title>

      <guid>https://blah.cloud/infrastructure/migrating-vsan-vmkernel-ports-new-subnet/</guid>
      <description>After deploying a vSAN cluster, the need sometimes arises to make changes to its network configuration, such as migrating the vmkernel network of the cluster to a new subnet. This requirement may appear for example when changing the network in which the vSAN cluster is running, or even, in a more complex scenario such as when a standalone vSAN needs to be converted to a stretched cluster.
In these sorts of situations, complications may be encountered if the subnet in use for the vSAN vmkernel ports cannot be routed to the network as a whole, as it is in use elsewhere in the organization, and is currently isolated in an L2 segment.</description>

      <title>vCloud Director console proxy and UI on a single interface</title>

      <guid>https://blah.cloud/cloud/vcloud-director-console-proxy-ui-single-ip/</guid>
      <description>I was recently rebuilding part of my lab infrastructure, and as part of it, I wanted to migrate my vCD cells from two IPs each to a single IP (as this feature was added in vCD 8.10) for both the web UI and the console proxy.
It simplifies provisioning, potential routing problems, and load-balancer configuration by having a single IP but separate ports for each service. Adding both services to a single IP is not new, Tomas Fjota wrote about it here, however, there was some detail missing from his article to allow it to work behind a load-balancer.</description>

      <description>I had a power outage recently that took out my entire lab in a very ungraceful manner - everything, well mostly everything, came back up without a hitch - but NSX was acting a bit weird, so I decided to redeploy the NSX Controllers.
I removed all 3 controllers and tried redeploying but ended up with the error &amp;ldquo;No IPs left in pool NSX-Controllers&amp;rdquo;. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with NSX, then you know when creating both controllers and VTEPs you&amp;rsquo;re required to configure IP Pools in NSX Manager to allocate IP addresses from.</description>

      <description>Over the last 9 months, a lot has happened in my life; I have a nice titanium plate in my shoulder now courtesy of a major car accident. I changed roles at Novosco from Infrastructure Engineer to Cloud Technologist - focusing more on R&amp;amp;D and emerging platforms, and I helped out Frank Denneman and Niels Hagoort in editing their best-selling vSphere 6.5 Host Deep Dive book.
Through the course of the time off I had as a result of now being part-Iron Man, it gave me a lot of time to think about what&amp;rsquo;s important to me and what I enjoy, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure most people do every few years.</description>

      <description>On a bit of a shorter note to my previous article/novella - I have been moving my lab to a bit more of an &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; style architecture - deploying SRM was in the way for that, so I had the need to set up another vCenter, however this gave the opportunity to move to a multi-PSC, multi-VC architecture.
There is quite some complexity in my lab with regard to vCenter and its integrations, I have running in production vRO, NSX and vCD - it&amp;rsquo;s also plugged into VIO and VR, so naturally I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to reinstall all these components and reconfigure them as a lot of work has gone in, in particular with NSX, dynamic peering etc set up with upstream routers and its integration with vCD.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have recently been working on a larger scale platform for my employer, it requires quick deployments of environments on VSAN with some standardised VIBs added in, initially we were doing this with a standard ESXi ISO install through iDRAC and then installing vCenter, vSphere Update Manager and pushing the VIBs to the hosts via that.
This is clearly a sub-optimal process and given our dedicated lab environment, we wanted to be able to spin up/down environments a bit more quickly - so we looked to optimising the install process and making production ready as the first step (as most people know, VSAN has some stringent HCL requirements when it comes to drivers and firmware).</description>

      <description>I have been testing out Runecast Analyzer in my lab recently - it&amp;rsquo;s pretty badass, you can set it up to scan your virtual infrastructure at a vCenter level and will scan your vC, VMs and hosts looking for KBs that may apply, security compliance and best practises.
 
As you can see my lab isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a model config when it comes to any of these things:</description>

      <guid>https://blah.cloud/infrastructure/fix-cbt-bug-vmware-products/</guid>
      <description>VMWare, as of writing, has a nasty bug that means your backups that run utilising CBT (hint: if you have basically any enterprise backup product worth its salt, it&amp;rsquo;s got CBT enabled) it loses track of the changed blocks when the VMDK reaches any Power 2 value of 128GB (128, 256, 512, 1024, etc.) which may make your backup unrecoverable.
The VMWare bug is in KB:
 kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2090639
 The remedy for this is to disable and re-enable (reset) CBT on the affected machines, this can be done with the machine powered off or with it turned on by running PowerCLI commands and a snapshot, we will be doing the latter, no one likes downtime:</description>
