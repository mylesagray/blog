      <description>On a bit of a shorter note to my previous article/novella â†— - I have been moving my lab to a bit more of an &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; style architecture - deploying SRM was in the way for that, so I had the need to set up another vCenter, however this gave the opportunity to move to a multi-PSC, multi-VC architecture.
There is quite some complexity in my lab with regard to vCenter and its integrations, I have running in production vRO, NSX and vCD - it&amp;rsquo;s also plugged into VIO and VR, so naturally I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to reinstall all these components and reconfigure them as a lot of work has gone in, in particular with NSX, dynamic peering etc set up with upstream routers and its integration with vCD.</description>
