      <description>I had a question last week from Bozo Popovic ↗ during our EMEA field SE training session on vSAN operations relating to SPBM support for service providers that use vCloud Director in their environments.

      <title>vCloud Director console proxy and UI on a single interface</title>

      <description>I was recently rebuilding part of my lab infrastructure, and as part of it, I wanted to migrate my vCD cells from two IPs each to a single IP (as this feature was added in vCD 8.10 ↗) for both the web UI and the console proxy.
It simplifies provisioning, potential routing problems, and load-balancer configuration by having a single IP but separate ports for each service. Adding both services to a single IP is not new, Tomas Fjota wrote about it here ↗, however, there was some detail missing from his article to allow it to work behind a load-balancer.</description>
