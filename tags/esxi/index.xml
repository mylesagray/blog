      <title>Migrating vSAN vmkernel ports to a new subnet</title>

      <description>After deploying a vSAN cluster, the need sometimes arises to make changes to its network configuration, such as migrating the vmkernel network of the cluster to a new subnet. This requirement may appear for example when changing the network in which the vSAN cluster is running, or even, in a more complex scenario such as when a standalone vSAN needs to be converted to a stretched cluster.
In these sorts of situations, complications may be encountered if the subnet in use for the vSAN vmkernel ports cannot be routed to the network as a whole, as it is in use elsewhere in the organization, and is currently isolated in an L2 segment.</description>

      <title>Configuring Auto Deploy Stateless Caching in vSphere 6.0</title>

      <description>Following on from my previous post on configuring custom ESXi images for PXE deployment, it piqued my interest again in Auto Deploy, now that I have a lab large enough (enough physical failure domains) to justify auto-deploy I figured i&amp;rsquo;d give it another go. I have chosen to implement stateless caching as it will allow the hosts to boot from the last used ESXi image they had if the PxE/AutoDeploy server goes down - then when it comes back up will pull the new version, this accounts for a total infrastructure outage and still allows the hosts to be bootable.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have recently been working on a larger scale platform for my employer, it requires quick deployments of environments on VSAN with some standardised VIBs added in, initially we were doing this with a standard ESXi ISO install through iDRAC and then installing vCenter, vSphere Update Manager and pushing the VIBs to the hosts via that.
This is clearly a sub-optimal process and given our dedicated lab environment, we wanted to be able to spin up/down environments a bit more quickly - so we looked to optimising the install process and making production ready as the first step (as most people know, VSAN has some stringent HCL requirements when it comes to drivers and firmware).</description>

      <title>vSphere Update Manager â€“ Cannot Scan Host</title>

      <description>I have been testing out Runecast Analyzer in my lab recently - it&amp;rsquo;s pretty badass, you can set it up to scan your virtual infrastructure at a vCenter level and will scan your vC, VMs and hosts looking for KBs that may apply, security compliance and best practises.
As you can see my lab isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a model config when it comes to any of these things:
It&amp;rsquo;s really very cool, syslogging is also built in, if you add it as a syslog target to your hosts (RCA can do this automatically too) it will monitor the syslogs incoming and search the KB database for any matching problems - I actually found that some of my iSCSI paths weren&amp;rsquo;t coming up after failover due to this!</description>

      <title>Setting Up Multi-NIC vMotion in vSphere 5.5</title>
      <link>https://blah.cloud/hardware/setting-multi-nic-vmotion-vsphere-5-5/</link>

      <description>Multi-NIC vMotion is a no-brainer configuration for performance:
 Faster maintenance mode operations Better DRS load balance operations Overall reduction in lead time of a manual vMotion process.  It was introduced in vSphere 5.0 and has improved in v5.5 - so let&amp;rsquo;s get into how to configure it (we&amp;rsquo;ll be using the vSphere Web Client because that&amp;rsquo;s what VMWare wants us to do nowadays&amp;hellip;).
 I don&amp;rsquo;t have an Enterprise Plus license so no Distributed Switches for me - however, if you do have Distributed Switching licenses you should be able to extrapolate from my Standard Switching how to config yours</description>
