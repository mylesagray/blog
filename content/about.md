So who is Myles?

I grew up in Newry, Northern Ireland and have always had an interest in computing [hardware][1]/[software][2] and performance, this has evolved somewhat into server applications and I love what I do.

I'm very into climbing, be it -20C on Ben Nevis in January or [25C in Spain in March][3], i'm there!

I also have a passion for engines and have a project car "Monochrome" that is a 2003 Mini Cooper S JCW, you can find more out about that [here][4] and [here][5].
