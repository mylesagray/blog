Obviously nowadays when admining we mostly have laptops - laptops don't tend to come with serial I/O ports anymore, so you buy a Serial -> USB adapter, [say this one][1] or any one with a legit (there are fakes) FDTI FT232RL chipset.

Download and install the relevant driversÂ but where do we go from here?

Specifically on mac, find your device's `tty` name:

```bash
cd /dev
ls -ltr *usb*
```

I added a handy little alias to my

`.bash_profile` so i don't have to remember the screen's tty connection name (obviously replace the `tty.usbserial-XXXXXXXX` with your converter's tty):

```bash
alias serial='screen /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXXX'
```

So you can use this to connect instead:

```bash
serial [baudrate]
```

You can of course use the same method to connect to Cisco switches and routers that have USB consoles:
