With the release of Cisco's new network simulation software (calling it this is a huge injustice) looming around the corner, just a brief taster of why you need Cisco VIRL for your home lab (also - latest info suggests it's free for individuals!):

Some more details of the features enabled:

Of course, there is a Cisco supported version called CML for enterprises that can scale much larger, but for a home lab you can't ask for more - VIRL will be available on [Cisco DevNet][1] very soon. It will run as a single VM image on your laptop/desktop - the CML version allows it to run on ESXi or bare-metal.
