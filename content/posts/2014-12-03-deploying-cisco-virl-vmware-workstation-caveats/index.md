I recently tried to deploy Cisco VIRL on VMWare Workstation 10 - [the install instructions][1] are for v8 - there are a few differences I noted.

* It doesn't account for the `host-only` network installed by default so increment all vmnets by `1`

![VMNet configuration VMware Workstation 10][2]

* The labelling for VT-x/EPT has changed, it now lives under **Settings -> Hardware -> Processors -> Virtualisation engine -> Preferred mode:**
* You need to explicitly select `Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI` mode

![Expose VT-x/EPT to VM in Workstation][3]

After this entering the `sudo kvm-ok` command in the VIRL CLI still output `KVM acceleration can NOT be used`.

I needed to edit the `.vmx` file directly and add/change these lines:

```ini
monitor.virtual_mmu = "hardware"
monitor.virtual_exec = "hardware"
vhv.enable = "TRUE"
monitor_control.restrict_backdoor = "true"
```

After that booting into VIRL and running `sudo kvm-ok` output `KVM acceleration can be used`.

Once this was overcome configuration went quite smoothly and was fairly simple to setup, be sure to [follow the tutorials][4] once you are ready to go.
