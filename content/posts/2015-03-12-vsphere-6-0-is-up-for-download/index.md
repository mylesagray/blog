A [slip of the tongue][1] earlier in the month mentioned that the release date might be March 12th, and here we are.

You can download all the vSphere 6.0 goodness from the newly revamped [my.vmware.com][2]

Docs [available here][3]. As always, it's just out, don't roll it right into production, without checking out [known issues][4], [your maximums][5] and [what's][6] [new][7].

Have fun!

P.S. If you want more "stuff" on this release, Eric has a great [post here][8].

Why not follow [@mylesagray on Twitter][9] for more like this!
