VMware has opened access to sign up for the next vSphere Beta (some cool things are being talked about in there!). Obviously, as with any public beta program there is an NDA/MSBTA that needs agreed to and a baseline understanding of 5.5 and 6.0 features such that feedback can be contributed.

You can sign up to the program here:

![Beta Signup][2] 

Obviously, using the latest and greatest is all well and good but to truly be part of the program you need to actually install the software in your lab/test environment, contribute feedback and bug reports through SRs and complete some surveys.

After all, it is you who will be using the software in the future so it's in your own best interest. It's also a great chance to find out other people's experiences with the software on the beta community forums and become part of the greater community, as a whole.

You can expect to download, install, and test vSphere Beta software in your environment or get invited to try new features in a VMware hosted environment. Plus, shaping the future of a product with your input is pretty cool :)
