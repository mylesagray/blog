Just a quick share, I applied to the VMware vExpert program at the end of last year, almost completely forgot about it until this showed up in [my Feedly][1] today:

A quick `Ctrl + F` and there I am :)

Should show up in the directory soon enough: [https://communities.vmware.com/vexpert.jspa][4]

This is more of just a "yahoo!" type post, but more meaningful content to come soon (under pseudo-NDA at the moment), in the mean time, thanks for tuning in!
