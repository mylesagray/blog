I was recently approached to write a guest blog post for Ravello Systems on Novosco's use of their AWS/GCE hosted ESXi labs for CI automation testing.

Ravello’s ESXi labs in particular is used by the Managed Service Platforms division.

In order to support our growth and deliver a consistent managed service quality across our client base we have standardized “checks” we run on environments at differing intervals.

This gives us a pro-active element and an ability to see problems before they emerge, or indeed catch them and detail for remediation.

There is only so much we can deliver reliably with manual effort, as such, to allow our MSP division to scale clients without needing to scale team size unnecessarily we turned, as any company would, to automation and scripting.
