Just a quick link referral today, I had the privilege to be interviewed by the great guys over at [OpenTechCast][1] during the UK VMUG in Birmingham a while back about the recent [datacenter networking article][2], more in the pipeline as well as system architecture and design, also a nice little prod at the end about a VCDX by [Kev Johnson][3].

You can hear me from **14:30** onward, check it out here: <http://www.opentechcast.com/2017/01/07/spep04-ukvmug/>
