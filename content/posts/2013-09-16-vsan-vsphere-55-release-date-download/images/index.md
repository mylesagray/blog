VMWare's [vSAN Community site][1] has been launched today in preparation for the release of vSphere 5.5 including the new vSAN feature (clustered, replicated local storage on hosts acting as a "Virtual SAN").

You can have a look at the [walkthroughs here][2]. You can sign up for the [beta program here][3], more [vSAN info available here][4].

Of course vSphere 5.5 offers many more features than just vSAN but this is their "flagship" innovation - and rightly so, what remains to be seen is what edition it appears in so we can tell what it's going to cost!
