## Intro

In the [last installment][1] we created an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS image to use to clone VMs from for spinning up our K8s nodes, we then cloned four VMs out, one as the master and three to be used as workers.

This time we are going to step through installing all the necessary K8s components on each of the nodes (`kubeadm`, `kubectl` and `kubelet`), the container runtime (Docker) and configuring the vSphere Cloud Provider for Kubernetes using `kubeadm` to bootstrap the cluster. We have a lot to cover, so let's get to it!

## Prerequisites

### Tools

I am using macOS, so will be using the `brew` package manager to install and manage my tools, if you are using Linux or Windows, use the appropriate install guide for each tool, according to your OS.

For each tool I will list the `brew` install command and the link to the install instructions for other OSes.

  * brew 
      * <https://brew.sh>
  * govc - `brew tap govmomi/tap/govc && brew install govmomi/tap/govc` 
      * <https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc>
  * kubectl - `brew install kubernetes-cli` 
      * <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>
  * tmux (optional) - `brew install tmux` 
      * <https://github.com/tmux/tmux>

### Optional use of tmux

If you want to speed things up and type the same commands to multiple sessions at once (there is going to be a lot or repetition otherwise), use `tmux` to open a SSH session to each of the IP addresses for your VMs (for more info see [here][2])

```bash
tmux new\; split-window\; split-window\; split-window\; select-layout even-vertical
# Use ctrl b, then the arrow keys to cycle through the tmux panes and SSH to each box independently
ssh ubuntu@vm.ip.address.here
```

If you followed my tutuorial last time and all your boxes are named in the `k8s*` pattern, you can use the below command to get their IP addresses

```bash
govc find / -type m -name 'k8s*' | xargs govc vm.info | grep 'Name:\|IP'
```

Once you have SSH'd in to each box independently, you can turn on synchronisation

<pre><code class="css">ctrl b, shift :, set synchronize-panes on
```

I did up a quick `asciinema` to [illustrate setup and use][3]:

## Setting up VMs with K8s components

### On all nodes

Install the container runtime (in our case Docker)

```bash
# Install Docker CE
# Update the apt package index
sudo apt update

## Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS
sudo apt install ca-certificates software-properties-common apt-transport-https curl -y

## Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

## Add docker apt repository.
sudo add-apt-repository \
"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(lsb_release -cs) \
stable"

# Install docker ce (latest supported for K8s 1.13 is Docker 18.06)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker-ce=18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu -y

# Setup daemon parameters, like log rotation and cgroups
sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json >/dev/null <<EOF
{
  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "100m"
  },
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
EOF

sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d

# Restart docker.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Install the K8s components

```bash
# Add the K8s repo to apt
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list >/dev/null

# Install kubelet, kubectl and kubeadm for cluster spinup
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kubelet kubeadm kubectl -y

# Hold K8s packages at their installed version so as not to upgrade unexpectedly on an apt upgrade
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

We will be using [`flannel`][5] for pod networking in this example, so the below needs to be run on all nodes to pass [bridged IPv4 traffic to iptables chains][6]:

```bash
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1
```

## Enabling the VMware vSphere Cloud Provider

### On the master(s)

#### Create your `vsphere.conf` file with vCenter details

For reference, my vCenter config looks as below (you can correlate the values in the UI to the values in the `vsphere.conf` file below):

![vCenter][7] 

Edit the below command to fill in your vCenter details before running.

If you don't have a folder created with your kubernetes node VMs added we can do that quickly with `govc` (note, change `vSAN-DC` to your Datacenter name in vCenter):

```bash
govc folder.create /vSAN-DC/vm/k8s
govc object.mv /vSAN-DC/vm/k8s-\* /vSAN-DC/vm/k8s
```

Details on [syntax can be found here][8]. It is important to note, whatever VM folder you specify below needs to be pre-created in your vCenter, in my case the folder is called `k8s`.

```bash
sudo tee /etc/kubernetes/vsphere.conf >/dev/null <<EOF
[Global]
user = "administrator@vsphere.local"
password = "Admin!23"
port = "443"
insecure-flag = "1"

[VirtualCenter "10.198.17.154"]
datacenters = "vSAN-DC"

[Workspace]
server = "10.198.17.154"
datacenter = "vSAN-DC"
default-datastore = "vsanDatastore"
resourcepool-path = "vSAN-Cluster/Resources"
folder = "k8s"

[Disk]
scsicontrollertype = pvscsi

[Network]
public-network = "VM Network"
EOF
```

Activate the vSphere Cloud Provider in our `kubeadm init` config file. Additionally, as we are deploying `flannel` as our overlay network for pods and it requires the below subnet CIDR in order for the overlay to work.

```yaml
sudo tee /etc/kubernetes/kubeadminitmaster.yaml >/dev/null <<EOF
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: InitConfiguration
bootstrapTokens:
       - groups:

EOF
```

Restart the kubelet daemon to reload the configuration

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

## Initialising the cluster with kubeadm

### On all nodes

Firstly, verify that connectivity to the required `gcr.io` registries is working by pulling the containers required by `kubeadm`

```bash
$ sudo kubeadm config images pull
[config/images] Pulled k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver:v1.13.2
[config/images] Pulled k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager:v1.13.2
[config/images] Pulled k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler:v1.13.2
[config/images] Pulled k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy:v1.13.2
[config/images] Pulled k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1
[config/images] Pulled k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.2.24
[config/images] Pulled k8s.gcr.io/coredns:1.2.6
```

### On the master node(s)

Initialise `kubeadm` with the config file from above which includes our vSphere Cloud Provider and Flannel CIDR configurations.

```bash
$ sudo kubeadm init --config /etc/kubernetes/kubeadminitmaster.yaml

Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join 10.198.17.177:6443 --token p8iv6v.zu8eofjtbc9r54dd --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:398f667fb3a6ffe6296e4d07c825834b54cce73bacf58641915cf79a1d1895f7
```

A lot of text will output as it spins up the cluster components, if all is successful, we can start using the cluster now by importing the `kubeconfig`.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

You can also use it on external systems by copying the output from the below command into your local computer's `~/.kube/config` file:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

Let's deploy our `flannel` pod overlay networking so the pods can communicate with each other.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/bc79dd1505b0c8681ece4de4c0d86c5cd2643275/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

Check to make sure the pods are all in the status `Running`:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE     NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

kube-system   kube-proxy-6grkv                     1/1     Running   0          2m19s
kube-system   kube-scheduler-k8s-master            1/1     Running   0          2m36s
```

Export the master node config used to point the workers being joined to the master:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-public get configmap cluster-info -o jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' > discovery.yaml
```

### On your laptop

Copy the `discovery.yaml` to your local machine with `scp`.

```bash
scp ubuntu@10.198.17.177:~/discovery.yaml discovery.yaml
```

Then upload it to the worker nodes.

```bash
scp discovery.yaml ubuntu@10.198.17.189:~/discovery.yaml
scp discovery.yaml ubuntu@10.198.17.190:~/discovery.yaml
scp discovery.yaml ubuntu@10.198.17.191:~/discovery.yaml
```

### On the worker nodes

To check and make sure the `discovery.yaml` file was copied correctly, do a quick `cat`.

```bash
cat ~/discovery.yaml
```

Then create the worker node `kubeadm` config yaml file (notice it's using our `discovery.yaml` as the input for master discovery) and the `token` is the same as we put in the master `kubeadminitmaster.yaml` configuration above and we specify the `cloud-provider` as `vsphere` for the workers:

```yaml
sudo tee /etc/kubernetes/kubeadminitworker.yaml >/dev/null <<EOF
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: JoinConfiguration
discoveryFile: discovery.yaml
token: y7yaev.9dvwxx6ny4ef8vlq
nodeRegistration:
  kubeletExtraArgs:
    cloud-provider: vsphere
EOF
```

And now we should be able to join our workers to the cluster.

```bash
$ sudo kubeadm join --config /etc/kubernetes/kubeadminitworker.yaml

[preflight] Running pre-flight checks

This node has joined the cluster:
* Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and a response was received.
* The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the master to see this node join the cluster.
```

## Verify setup

Now, as the output says above, back on the master check that all nodes have joined the cluster

```bash
ubuntu@k8s-master:~$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME          STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION      CONTAINER-RUNTIME

k8s-worker2   Ready    <none>   32s     v1.13.2   10.198.17.175   <none>          Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS   4.15.0-43-generic   docker://18.6.0
k8s-worker3   Ready    <none>   32s     v1.13.2   10.198.17.176   <none>          Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS   4.15.0-43-generic   docker://18.6.0
```

Verify the `providerID` is set on all the nodes for the VCP to operate correctly:

```bash
ubuntu@k8s-master:~$ kubectl describe nodes | grep "ProviderID"
ProviderID:                  vsphere://420f0d85-cf4a-c7a7-e52d-18e9b4b71dec
ProviderID:                  vsphere://420fc2b2-64ab-a477-f7b1-37d4e6747abf
ProviderID:                  vsphere://420f2d75-37bd-8b56-4e2f-421cbcbbb0b2
ProviderID:                  vsphere://420f7ec3-2dbd-601e-240b-4ee6d8945210
```

We now have a fully up and running k8s cluster with the vSphere Cloud Provider installed! Check out [part 3 where we install][9] the K8s dashboard and show how the integration with the vSphere Cloud Provider really works!
