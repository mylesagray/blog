I have been lucky enough to have had one of my articles selected for the vSphere Design Pocketbook v3 - After a little waiting, the vSphere Design Pocketbook v3 is now available for download, with print coming along shortly. You can find my original article included here: <https://blah.cloud/infrastructure/safely-checkremove-orphaned-vmdk-files-from-esxi/>

As Frank says, and is very important, at least to me is feedback from peers:

> When you visit VMworld, VMUGs, or any other event where you bump into community members who have provided you with valuable content, I encourage you to talk to them and tell them you like their work. A little appreciation goes a long way – and it’s the fuel that keeps these amazing people going.
