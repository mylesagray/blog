VMWare's [vSAN Community site][1] has been launched today in preparation for the release of vSphere 5.5 including the new vSAN feature (clustered, replicated local storage on hosts acting as a &#8220;Virtual SAN&#8221;).<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-807" alt="vSAN Public Beta Site" src="https://blah.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-09-16-at-16.07.41.png" /> You can have a look at the [walkthroughs here][2]. You can sign up for the [beta program here][3], more [vSAN info available here][4]. Of course vSphere 5.5 offers many more features than just vSAN but this is their &#8220;flagship&#8221; innovation - and rightly so, what remains to be seen is what edition it appears in so we can tell what it's going to cost!<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-809" alt="vSAN Public Beta Website" src="https://blah.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-09-16-at-16.09.10.png" width="993" height="421" /> [vSAN Datasheet][5] / [vSphere 5.5 What's New][6] Keep an eye out here as I update with more info on the beta of vSAN and vSphere 5.5. **Update 20/09/13 11:00am:** vSphere environment for Windows v5.5 now live, [download here!][7]<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847" alt="vSphere 5.5 Windows Client" src="https://blah.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-09-20-at-11.17.36.png" width="458" height="554" /> [vSphere v5.5][8] / [ESXi v5.5][9] / [vSA][10] download pages now up<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-843" alt="vSphere 5.5 Download Page" src="https://blah.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-09-20-at-10.04.35.png" width="710" height="451" />
