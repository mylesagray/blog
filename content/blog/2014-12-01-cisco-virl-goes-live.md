A quick quote from the site describes nicely what it is:

> VIRL is comprehensive network design and simulation platform. VIRL includes a powerful graphical user interface for network design and simulation control, a configuration engine that can build complete Cisco configuration at the push of a button, Cisco virtual machines running same network operating systems as used in Ciscoâ€™s physical routers and switches, all running on top of OpenStack.
