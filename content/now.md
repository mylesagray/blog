## So, what _am_ I doing, _now_?

### Life

I'm living in the countryside near [Comber, Northern Ireland](https://www.google.com/maps/@54.5249246,-5.6850625,3035m/data=!3m1!1e3). With my partner, and two Italian Greyhounds - Gnocchi and Capo - who love nothing more than to announce themselves on Zoom calls.

### Hobbies

I finally got round to finishing [that Mini](/miscellaneous/another-racecar-engine-build/) after some coaxing from my brother for my 30th birthday, it's got (another) new engine, suspension and a new ECU tune.

I've been into 3D printing for a number of years, since about 2014 

### Music

Music has always played a massive part in my life, in fact it's hard to overstate it just how critical it is to me. My taste has gone through many iterations, but not to the extent where all of the previous iteration is lost or forgotten about - usually it builds and I find hybrids of genres and sounds I enjoy.

My latest fascination is vinyl. I've become one of those unapologetic hipsters who buys new music on vinyl from bands I really aprecciate in order to support them, and man, it's just amazing how that needle works. _Still plays the record through a wireless sound system._

The _tous les jours_ right now is:

If you're into music like this, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mylesagray), I could talk about this for hours.
### Work/Research

I've been focusing a lot on components of infrastructure that are higher in the stack than my pervious wheelhouse. Think Kubernetes and above; Things like [Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/), [Event-based programming and serving](https://github.com/mylesagray/tanzu-cloudnativeruntimes-eventing-workshop), [building and serving Machine Learning models scalably](https://github.com/mylesagray/anpr-knative), [GitOps](https://github.com/mylesagray/home-cluster-gitops), [Continuous Delivery](https://argocd.apps.blah.cloud/)

## What's a Now Page?

"Now" pages are inspired by [Derek Sivers](http://nownownow.com/about). They attempt to answer the question: "What is this person focused on at this exact point in their life?" Whist all the masses of information on my [about](/about) page and [works](/works) page tell you what I've done, they don't tell you what I'm doing now, what I'm going to do, nor what's important to me.
