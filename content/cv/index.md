## Profile

A passionate technologist with a natural, curious, urge to always learn "the new thing" and teach people about it. A strong public speaker with a natural, genuine and relatable feel when talking and giving seminars in front of large groups - formally and informally. Teamwork is a core tenet of how I approach my work, I live by the "hit by a bus" mentality, everything is out in the open and documented for others to replicate.

My background includes considerable experience researching, designing, building, operating and supporting enterprise IT infrastructure and solutions, from both the end customer and service provider sides.

I have grown between roles from end-user engineer implementing other's designs, to architecting scalable solutions for multi-tenant private clouds, through working at vendors on the products I have used personally through my engineering journey.

This background allows me to provide valuable, realistic feedback to product and engineering teams on what customers want, while building collateral and giving talks on how new features can benefit users in the positions I found myself in, in the past.

## Experience

### VMware

_For an overview of the content I've created at VMware, check out my [works page](/works)._

My role at VMware was consistent – but my focus areas changed over time as my interests developed.

Technical Marketing/Dev Advocacy focuses on evangelising product or technologies publicly, building collateral (Git repos, webinars, seminars, demos, presentation decks, YouTube videos, podcasts, etc), training teams internally, engaging with customers on pre-sales calls in addition to at conferences or 1-1 on social media, providing feedback to product management and engineering on how features are received alongside customer asks or wishes. A large portion of my time is spent in research and trying out new technologies with an aim to figure out how they tie in with the products I look after.
