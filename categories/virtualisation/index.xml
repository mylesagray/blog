      <description>I had a question last week from Bozo Popovic ↗ during our EMEA field SE training session on vSAN operations relating to SPBM support for service providers that use vCloud Director in their environments.

      <title>Migrating vSAN vmkernel ports to a new subnet</title>
      <link>https://blah.cloud/infrastructure/migrating-vsan-vmkernel-ports-new-subnet/</link>

      <description>After deploying a vSAN cluster, the need sometimes arises to make changes to its network configuration, such as migrating the vmkernel network of the cluster to a new subnet. This requirement may appear for example when changing the network in which the vSAN cluster is running, or even, in a more complex scenario such as when a standalone vSAN needs to be converted to a stretched cluster.
In these sorts of situations, complications may be encountered if the subnet in use for the vSAN vmkernel ports cannot be routed to the network as a whole, as it is in use elsewhere in the organization, and is currently isolated in an L2 segment.</description>

      <title>vCloud Director console proxy and UI on a single interface</title>

      <description>I was recently rebuilding part of my lab infrastructure, and as part of it, I wanted to migrate my vCD cells from two IPs each to a single IP (as this feature was added in vCD 8.10 ↗) for both the web UI and the console proxy.
It simplifies provisioning, potential routing problems, and load-balancer configuration by having a single IP but separate ports for each service. Adding both services to a single IP is not new, Tomas Fjota wrote about it here ↗, however, there was some detail missing from his article to allow it to work behind a load-balancer.</description>

      <title>Migrating from VCSA embedded PSC to external PSC</title>

      <description>On a bit of a shorter note to my previous article/novella ↗ - I have been moving my lab to a bit more of an &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; style architecture - deploying SRM was in the way for that, so I had the need to set up another vCenter, however this gave the opportunity to move to a multi-PSC, multi-VC architecture.
There is quite some complexity in my lab with regard to vCenter and its integrations, I have running in production vRO, NSX and vCD - it&amp;rsquo;s also plugged into VIO and VR, so naturally I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to reinstall all these components and reconfigure them as a lot of work has gone in, in particular with NSX, dynamic peering etc set up with upstream routers and its integration with vCD.</description>

      <title>Replicating SAN on openSUSE with VAAI</title>
      <link>https://blah.cloud/hardware/replicating-san-opensuse-vaai/</link>

      <guid>https://blah.cloud/hardware/replicating-san-opensuse-vaai/</guid>
      <description>Preamble This article was written a few years back, but never published - it was some work I was doing in my lab to try and get to grips around the work involved in creating a SAN with synchronous replication built in from scratch.
It in no way should be used for production, but rather as a learning exercise - as previously stated the instructions are a few years old and version specific, so openSUSE may well now support some of the modules I had to compile and create repos for manually, also DRBD9 has been released and should obviously be used in place of DRBD8 as I have below.</description>

      <title>Configuring Auto Deploy Stateless Caching in vSphere 6.0</title>
      <link>https://blah.cloud/automation/configuring-auto-deploy-stateless-caching-vsphere-6-0/</link>

      <description>Following on from my previous post on configuring custom ESXi images for PXE deployment, it piqued my interest again in Auto Deploy, now that I have a lab large enough (enough physical failure domains) to justify auto-deploy I figured i&amp;rsquo;d give it another go. I have chosen to implement stateless caching as it will allow the hosts to boot from the last used ESXi image they had if the PxE/AutoDeploy server goes down - then when it comes back up will pull the new version, this accounts for a total infrastructure outage and still allows the hosts to be bootable.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have recently been working on a larger scale platform for my employer, it requires quick deployments of environments on VSAN with some standardised VIBs added in, initially we were doing this with a standard ESXi ISO install through iDRAC and then installing vCenter, vSphere Update Manager and pushing the VIBs to the hosts via that.
This is clearly a sub-optimal process and given our dedicated lab environment, we wanted to be able to spin up/down environments a bit more quickly - so we looked to optimising the install process and making production ready as the first step (as most people know, VSAN has some stringent HCL requirements when it comes to drivers and firmware).</description>

      <description>I have been testing out Runecast Analyzer ↗ in my lab recently - it&amp;rsquo;s pretty badass, you can set it up to scan your virtual infrastructure at a vCenter level and will scan your vC, VMs and hosts looking for KBs that may apply, security compliance and best practises.
 
As you can see my lab isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a model config when it comes to any of these things:</description>

 It doesn&amp;rsquo;t account for the host-only network installed by default so increment all vmnets by 1   
 The labelling for VT-x/EPT has changed, it now lives under Settings -&amp;gt; Hardware -&amp;gt; Processors -&amp;gt; Virtualisation engine -&amp;gt; Preferred mode: You need to explicitly select Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI mode</description>

      <guid>https://blah.cloud/infrastructure/fix-cbt-bug-vmware-products/</guid>
      <description>VMWare, as of writing, has a nasty bug that means your backups that run utilising CBT (hint: if you have basically any enterprise backup product worth its salt, it&amp;rsquo;s got CBT enabled) it loses track of the changed blocks when the VMDK reaches any Power 2 value of 128GB (128, 256, 512, 1024, etc.) which may make your backup unrecoverable.
The VMWare bug is in KB:
 kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2090639 ↗
 The remedy for this is to disable and re-enable (reset) CBT on the affected machines, this can be done with the machine powered off or with it turned on by running PowerCLI commands and a snapshot, we will be doing the latter, no one likes downtime ↗:</description>

      <description>I had recently come across the need to deploy an OVA file remotely and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to upload the file over VPN to the destination vCenter, the solution is to install OVFTool ↗ on a server that has local access to the vCenter and deploy it using the following syntax:
