      <title>vSphere 6.5 Host Resources Deep Dive</title>

      <description>Over the last 6-9 months, I have been reviewing the vast majority of a new book just released to print by Frank Denneman and Niels Hagoort - The vSphere 6.5 Host Resources Deep Dive.
 
This book is, without a doubt, the most in-depth look at host design I have ever read, we are not talking about standard best practices here, though those are in there too. More, low-level understanding of why best practices exist and even challenging some existing perceptions and paradigms about why technologies should be used and more importantly, how they should be utilised.</description>

      <title>My home datacenter.</title>

      <description>I have been meaning to write this for a very long time, finally inspired by seeing Russell Pope&amp;rsquo;s absolutely insane lab in the vExpert Slack and Mark Brookfield&amp;rsquo;s homelab post it started when my lab was a single Dell R710 with 96GB RAM and 2x X5670 procs. The home lab has stopped being a lab and become a datacenter in that time and it&amp;rsquo;s about time I put it down on paper.</description>

      <title>Replicating SAN on openSUSE with VAAI</title>
      <link>https://blah.cloud/hardware/replicating-san-opensuse-vaai/</link>

      <description>Preamble This article was written a few years back, but never published - it was some work I was doing in my lab to try and get to grips around the work involved in creating a SAN with synchronous replication built in from scratch.
It in no way should be used for production, but rather as a learning exercise - as previously stated the instructions are a few years old and version specific, so openSUSE may well now support some of the modules I had to compile and create repos for manually, also DRBD9 has been released and should obviously be used in place of DRBD8 as I have below.</description>

      <description>After a long an arduous certification and regression testing process following many problems with LSI 3108 based controllers that I have been using for VSAN they are finally VSAN 6.2 certified.
Having seen and opened multiple tickets about strange controller behaviors (hot add controller do VMware have released a FW/HW and Software combo that, according to a highly regarded VMware internal storage resource:
 Its certainly the most tested combination of a firmware/driver/controller ever at this point [&amp;hellip;] My understanding is the reason this took so long is they didnâ€™t just fix the big issue, but also minor ones too, and any minor regressions</description>

      <title>Check action progress on Dell MD3000i array</title>

      <guid>https://blah.cloud/hardware/check-action-progress-dell-md3000i-array/</guid>
      <description>One of the things that the Dell MD Storage Manager is a progress indicator for rebuild operations or any actions at all really, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly simple to do, but you have to use the command line tool SMcli.exe that comes with MD Storage Manager.
First navigate to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Dell\MD Storage Software\MD Storage Manager\client Then execute:
SMcli.exe {your.san.ip.address} -p {password} -c &amp;#34;show virtualDisk [\&amp;#34;name-of-vdisk\&amp;#34;] actionProgress;&amp;#34; Obviously replace the curly braces with appropriate values - as well as the &amp;quot;name-of-vdisk&amp;quot; the square brackets are part of the syntax.</description>

      <title>Setting Up Multi-NIC vMotion in vSphere 5.5</title>

      <guid>https://blah.cloud/hardware/setting-multi-nic-vmotion-vsphere-5-5/</guid>
      <description>Multi-NIC vMotion is a no-brainer configuration for performance:
 Faster maintenance mode operations Better DRS load balance operations Overall reduction in lead time of a manual vMotion process.  It was introduced in vSphere 5.0 and has improved in v5.5 - so let&amp;rsquo;s get into how to configure it (we&amp;rsquo;ll be using the vSphere Web Client because that&amp;rsquo;s what VMWare wants us to do nowadays&amp;hellip;).
 I don&amp;rsquo;t have an Enterprise Plus license so no Distributed Switches for me - however, if you do have Distributed Switching licenses you should be able to extrapolate from my Standard Switching how to config yours</description>

      <title>Teaming ReadyNAS Ultra NICs</title>

      <description>Introduction Netgear for some reason believe that ReadyNAS models that aren&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;ldquo;Pro&amp;rdquo; line don&amp;rsquo;t require network teaming across both their ethernet ports, so you have 2 network ports on your NAS, you&amp;rsquo;ve got your jumbo frames on and you want to configure load balancing/failover via the 2 interfaces.
Of course the ReadyNAS is based on Debian linux, you could SSH into the box and use /etc/network/interfaces to configure a networking bond using: mode=balance-rr or using aggregated link spec 802.</description>
