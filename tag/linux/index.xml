      <title>Creating an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS cloud image for cloning on VMware</title>

      <description>Intro I have been experimenting a lot over the past 18 months with containers and in particular, Kubernetes, and one of the core things I always seemed to get hung up on was part-zero - creating the VMs to actually run K8s. I wanted a CLI only way to build a VM template for the OS and then deploy that to the cluster.
It turns out that with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (in particular the cloud image OVA) there are a few things need changed from the base install (namely cloud-init) in order to make them play nice with OS Guest Customisation in vCenter.</description>

      <description>I had a bit of a storage outage in my lab due to a funky behaviour on the Synology that I use as primary storage for all my VMs:
Today I Learned: Adding IP address to interfaces on Synology causes reboots :/ Lab now in not such great shape. 80 VMs with APD. #vExpert
&amp;mdash; Myles Gray (@mylesagray) November 13, 2016  Most stuff came back up or could at least be trivially fixed (like VCSA, PSCs, etc) you can edit the GRUB boot string and force into /bin/bash then run fsck from there.</description>

      <title>Replicating SAN on openSUSE with VAAI</title>
      <link>https://blah.cloud/hardware/replicating-san-opensuse-vaai/</link>

      <description>Preamble This article was written a few years back, but never published - it was some work I was doing in my lab to try and get to grips around the work involved in creating a SAN with synchronous replication built in from scratch.
It in no way should be used for production, but rather as a learning exercise - as previously stated the instructions are a few years old and version specific, so openSUSE may well now support some of the modules I had to compile and create repos for manually, also DRBD9 has been released and should obviously be used in place of DRBD8 as I have below.</description>
