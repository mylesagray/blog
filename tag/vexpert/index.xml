      <description>Over the last 9 months, a lot has happened in my life; I have a nice titanium plate in my shoulder now courtesy of a major car accident. I changed roles at Novosco from Infrastructure Engineer to Cloud Technologist - focusing more on R&amp;amp;D and emerging platforms, and I helped out Frank Denneman and Niels Hagoort in editing their best-selling vSphere 6.5 Host Deep Dive book.
Through the course of the time off I had as a result of now being part-Iron Man, it gave me a lot of time to think about what&amp;rsquo;s important to me and what I enjoy, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure most people do every few years.</description>
